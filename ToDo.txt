TO DO:

Wishlist:

) Stream linecode 0
	>Reassess Programs' internal validity with variables
		>clarify variable names throughout - master list
		>re-adjust Sp# spacer variable (so _ isn't disallowed in home/* names) 
			>create a system check for unacceptable names?

) streamline code 1


) Small prog for checking if drives mounted in specific (constant) location
	) keep mounting seperate or join into BBB (prob stand alone with step) 
	) see crypt3.sh	
	) partition mount check prog
		>New config for drives labels, mntpoint, & uuid
		>Write computer side setup instructions
		>Darcy Double Check, search for file with uuid on location
				str="ABCD"
				content=$(cat test.txt)
				if [ "$str" == "$content" ];then
				    # send your email
				fi
		>if found provide list for choices for use in new dialog

) add proper Redo and Cancel options, with loops
#hence forth cancel restoration, extra addition in place of redo.
#Need to check and overhaul dialog --checklist options
#nested loops (break n) n=nested loops to break.
	) Add "Redo" - 1 loop for: location, user/input, program, folders

	) Add dialog loop for location in dest or not
		>If not in dest > Select dest from drives that pass check
		>If in dest > usual prompt to verify
		>extra button is redo, cancel actually cancels 
		3 windows (y/n for in location, radio for drive select, confirmation)
	
	) Confirm Folder Options - Confirm, Redo, Cancel
		Redo can go back to folders and program

	) reprint final info on double check
		>add each prog version (including master)
		>Extra = New radiolist for Redo + each layer back)
		
) streamline code 2 
	
) check that inert and live rsync and tar match
	both should: 
	>Check for unique dest folder specified from var
	>Check consistency in outputs

) add code option for inert running 
	>Have this change master vers number so final confirmation prints
	>Dialog should actually be pulled by seperate head prog
	>Master inert flag goes there to progs 
		>RS, TAR, Dialog, etc. can all read it read it
		>Master prog manages 
			>inert flag coding, 
			>load var
			>setting prgnm (rm from var)
			>making appropriately named log files
			>clearing temp files
		
	
) Make a readme user guide

) improve documentation (comments, change logs, howto: advanced changes, etc)

) tidy code, potentially make more prog/config as needed

) server backup program (more steps as needed)
	>hard switch in Master prog
	>Obviously different config files (diff names & loc)
	>Try not to alter progs too much
		>Resuse as much code as possible
		>common progs reuse in state
		>altered or unique to be renamed

) improve TX.sh on server
	> simplify opening vs clossing ssh password in mini-script
	>
