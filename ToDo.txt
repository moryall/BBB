Wishlist for version 3:

) Principle Goals for Version 3:
	1) Increase shell security
	2) Incease useability
	3) Create effective documentation & code streamlining.
	
	
1) Increase shell security
	) fucntions and permissions instead of whole sudo wrapper.
		> call specific functions by path not name
		> protect user input and file changes
	> Language around cwd and srcd

2) Incease useability
	) independant driveAttach
		> Shares driveCheck config, but can edit and make check.file
		> Documentation for specifically how to get and add data to crypttab & fstab
	) easy settings for "default" location
	) reprint on final double-check: everything in cluding (sub)programs versions
	) add code option for inert running 
		>Have this change master vers number so final confirmation prints as inert
		>Master inert flag goes from master to programs (tar and rs) 
			>RS, TAR, Dialog, etc. can all read it
			>Master prog manages 
				>inert flag coding, 
				>load var
				>setting prgnm (rm from var)
				>making appropriately named log files
				>clearing temp files
			>tar inert potential: tar -cvf /dev/null mydir 
	) server backup program Integration (more steps as needed)
		>hard switch in Master prog
		>Try not to alter progs too much
			>Resuse as much code as possible
			>common progs reuse in state
			>altered or unique to be renamed

3) Create effective documentation & code streamlining.
	> Better README.md
	> Get into proper semantic versioning & changelog
