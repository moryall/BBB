TO DO:

Wishlist:


) Small prog for checking if drives mounted in specific (constant) location
	) integrate driveCheck add a config file & integrate into BBB
	) create more independant driveAttach, but as clean way to read ^ config, as well as write to it (and create check.file)
	) Add dialog loop for location in dest or not
		>If not in dest > Select dest from drives that pass check
		>If in dest > usual prompt to verify
		>extra button is redo, cancel actually cancels 
		3 windows
			1) Y/N in destination?
				No) radiolist for drive select
				Yes) Continue
			2) Is this location correct? 
				Yes) continue
				No) Extra, back to 2
				Cancel) exit
	
) reprint final info on double check
	>add each prog version (including master)
		
) streamline code 2 & documentation
	
) add code option for inert running 
	>Have this change master vers number so final confirmation prints as inert
	>Master inert flag goes from master to programs (tar and rs) 
		>RS, TAR, Dialog, etc. can all read it
		>Master prog manages 
			>inert flag coding, 
			>load var
			>setting prgnm (rm from var)
			>making appropriately named log files
			>clearing temp files
		>tar inert potential: tar -cvf /dev/null mydir 
		
) Make a readme user guide

) improve documentation (comments, change logs, howto: advanced changes, etc)

) tidy code, potentially make more prog/config as needed

) server backup program (more steps as needed)
	>hard switch in Master prog
	>Obviously different config files (diff names & loc)
	>Try not to alter progs too much
		>Resuse as much code as possible
		>common progs reuse in state
		>altered or unique to be renamed

) improve TX.sh on server
	> simplify opening vs clossing ssh password in mini-script
	> setup to run BBB
