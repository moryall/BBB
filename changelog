Scheme for version numbers is as follows:
	Version_Code: change if sig change in UI, functionality, or addition or removal of sub-programs/features or directory layout. Some variable changes may qualify, and ANY change to how config files are used or located. 
	Sub_Prog: change if a sub program changes full version #
	MinorTweaks: spelling, formatting displays, etc. 
	Use of "x" prior to Version is for experimental features/version.	

Use of subprogram's internal change log will be numbered as follows. 
    00.00
    Version_Code.MinorChanges
	    	Version_Code: change if sig alteration in input or output
	    	MinorChanges: change as needed for code or spelling changes
	    		also used in event another prog causes small fixes (e.g. like change in variable names but not how it it used in/out).
